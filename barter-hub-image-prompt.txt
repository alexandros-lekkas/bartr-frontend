Create a stylized architectural visualization of the Barter Hub, a modern trading space located in the World Fashion Center in Amsterdam. 

STYLE & AESTHETICS:
- Clean, modern architectural rendering style similar to high-end architectural visualizations
- Stylized but not overly realistic - think of a polished 3D render with soft lighting
- Bright, airy atmosphere with natural daylight streaming in
- Minimalist color palette: whites, light grays, soft blues, and warm wood accents
- Smooth surfaces with subtle textures, no harsh shadows or overly dramatic lighting
- Professional architectural visualization aesthetic - like something from a luxury real estate brochure

ARCHITECTURE & SPACE:
- Modern, open-plan interior space with high ceilings
- Large floor-to-ceiling windows showing glimpses of Amsterdam's urban landscape
- Clean lines, contemporary furniture, and minimalist design elements
- Display areas or shelves showcasing various items for trade (books, electronics, art, clothing)
- Open trading floor with designated areas for different activities
- Modern lighting fixtures - pendant lights or track lighting
- Polished concrete or light wood flooring
- Glass partitions or dividers creating semi-private spaces
- A reception or welcome area near the entrance
- Plants and greenery for a welcoming, organic touch

PEOPLE (STYLIZED FIGURES):
- Include 5-8 stylized human figures throughout the space
- People should be rendered in the same clean, stylized architectural visualization style
- Not photorealistic - more like simplified 3D models or architectural figure silhouettes
- Diverse group: different ages, genders, and ethnicities
- Figures engaged in various activities:
  * Some browsing items on display
  * A couple engaged in conversation/exchange
  * Someone at a reception desk
  * A person examining an item
  * Figures walking through the space
- Figures should be proportional and well-integrated into the scene
- Soft, subtle colors for clothing that match the overall palette
- Figures should feel natural and not overly posed

ATMOSPHERE & DETAILS:
- Warm, inviting atmosphere that feels both professional and community-oriented
- Sense of movement and activity but not crowded
- Modern Amsterdam urban context visible through windows (contemporary buildings, cityscape)
- "Barter Hub" signage or branding elements subtly integrated
- Clean, organized space that suggests efficiency and professionalism
- Natural materials mixed with modern finishes
- The space should feel like a contemporary co-working space or modern marketplace

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- Wide-angle perspective showing the full space
- Professional architectural photography angle (slightly elevated, showing depth)
- High resolution, crisp details
- Soft, even lighting throughout
- Color grading: slightly desaturated, clean and modern
- No harsh shadows or dramatic contrasts
- Professional architectural visualization quality

The overall image should look like a high-end architectural rendering that could be used in a real estate or design portfolio - clean, modern, stylized, and professional.
